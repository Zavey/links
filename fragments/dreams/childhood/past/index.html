<h3>
  What must happen now
  is that the small funerals
  celebrated in the left-behind life

  for their black exotica, their high relief,

  their candles and withered wreaths,
  must be allowed to pass through
  into the sleeping world,

  there to be preserved and honored
  in the fullness and color of their forms,

  their <a href="innocent/index.html" class="yeet"><h1>past</a></h1>  lives their coffins.
</h3>
